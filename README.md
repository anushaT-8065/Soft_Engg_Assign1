# Disaster alert system
The Disaster Alert System is a real-time monitoring platform that provides alerts for disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and landslides. It allows users to view disaster updates, configure alert preferences, and receive notifications. This system is built using Flask and allows users receive updates.
A database of users is maintained for clarity and organisation.
